## 2. Internal Storage:
Pros: Provides private storage space within the app's sandbox, ensuring data security and privacy.

Cons: Limited in capacity and not accessible to other apps or users, restricting data sharing or backup options.
## 3. External Storage (SD card):
Pros: Offers larger storage capacity and flexibility for storing media files like images or videos.

Cons: Requires additional permissions and may not always be available or accessible, depending on device configuration.
## 4. SQLite Database:
Pros: Provides a structured and efficient way to store and retrieve structured data, suitable for complex data models.
